    <h2><em>The Restaurant</em></h2>
    <p>
        Jack’s Famous BBQ started serving the community in 2024. Founded by our pitmaster, Jack, out of necessity for authentic and traditional Texas-style BBQ, the restaurant offers a unique offering of slow-smoked meats including Baby Back Ribs, Brisket, Pulled Pork, Glazed Pork Chops, and so much more! We hope to see you soon! .

    <h2><em>About Jack</em></h2>
    <p>
        Jack Jones is a business owner, father, husband, and a pitmaster from Houston, Texas. His love for BBQ started at a young age when he would help his father smoke, grill, and sear meat on his family’s generations-old steel charcoal smoker. His love and passion for BBQ only expanded from there: Jack would eventually inherit the smoker and start selling his delicious meats at fairs, catering events, and festivals all over the Lone Star State. Jack’s Famous BBQ is his first stand alone restaurant. In time Jack hopes to expand his brand all across the nation. .
